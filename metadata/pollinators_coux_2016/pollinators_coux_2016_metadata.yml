  title: Pollinator functional traits
  description: Functional traits of pollinators from the Canterbury region, South Island, New Zealand. For each pollinator species, we compiled information for the following 9 traits: (1) body length (mm); (2) body width, measured as distance between the base of the wings in mm (i.e. intertegula span in bees); (3) flower visiting time: mean duration of flower visitation in s; (4) foraging preference of adults: nectar or pollen (proportions of their diet made of nectar vs. pollen,  in 2 different columns, sum of both equals 100%); (6) behaviour: social or solitary; (7) larval feeding type: nectar or pollen, decaying vegetation, carrion, parasite, dung, predator of other insect (binary: 1 or 0 if not part of diet);  (8) pollen carrying structure: scopa, corbicula, none; (9) month of seasonal abundance peak; (10) time of daily abundance peak. Morphological trait values (e.g. body length and width) were derived by obtaining the mean dimensions of ten representative specimens. Traits related to foraging preferences and flower visitation were measured in mass flowering Brassica rapa fields as part of another study (Rader et al., 2009). Data were collected in Field Based Observation Studies (FBOS) conducted by Rader et al., 2014, or from other Literature: Colles & McAlpine 1991; Howlett et al. 2005; Donovan 2007; Michener 2007; Rader et al. 2009.
